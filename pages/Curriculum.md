		- ## CV Writing
			- In reading your CV, I did not find the kind of active language that would bring your work to life. Instead, **I saw passive words and non-action verbs.
			  
			  **Phrases like **“responsible for”** and **“Managing”** are monotonous, overused, and add little value to your CV. Strong action verbs, used with engaging language to outline outstanding achievements, are essential parts of a soundly-built CV.
			  
			  Now, let's see how to put this into practice. Here's a real life sample taken from a former client's CV. By changing the language, we helped to enhance the perception of the job-seeker.
			- **Passive language / Doing:** “Negotiated contracts with vendors”
			- **Action language / Achieving:** “Slashed payroll/benefits administration costs 30% by negotiating pricing and fees, while ensuring the continuation and enhancements of services.”
		- ### DIgital Readiness
			- Although CV in pdf are consistent some older Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) could not read you CV properly.
			- Use .docx instead
