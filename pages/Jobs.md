		- Profile
			- About
				- As a development professional with nearly three years of experience, I have acquired extensive technical skills and made significant contributions across various projects. My proficiency is in WEB development with Typescript, React and Node.js, as well as database management with SAP HANA. I have also become adept at using tools and methodologies such as Git, GitHub, and Agile Methods, primarily utilizing Jira for project management.
				- Throughout my career, I have been involved in full-stack development, handling both front-end and back-end components from the initial client consultation through to deployment. This process has included creating comprehensive technical documentation, both for gathering requirements and for serving as reference material for new employees.
				- Quality assurance has been a critical part of my role, where I have conducted detailed inspection, resolution, and documentation of bugs to ensure fast and effective solutions for clients. Additionally, I have developed Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions to automate repetitive tasks, thereby allowing team members to focus on more intellectually demanding and profitable work.
				- Employing Agile methodologies has enabled me to address issues promptly and efficiently, ensuring the timely delivery of projects. In terms of client interaction, I have maintained direct communication with clients to ensure alignment on project requirements and deliverables. Furthermore, I have worked collaboratively within cross-functional teams to enhance project outcomes and improve workflow processes.
