  collapsed:: true
	- Always start with a briefing 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Be clear about what are you making and who are you making it for.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Be detailed about the in regards of the final content and fill the brief with it.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The brief will serve as fundament for the wireframe.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- # WireFrame
  collapsed:: true
	- **Low fidelity prototype**
	- Is not the final design of  the project
	  background-color:: red
	- If the UX and UI are handled by different people you can be messy about it, no need to make it look like the final version, also, if you're both the UX and the UI designer you can make it look more like a final project from the w ireframe stages
