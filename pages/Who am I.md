- # About
	- I'm 30 years old and quite frankly I feel like a mess, at this age I should, at the least be able to make end meet professionally, which I cannot. I'm unemployed, due to my inability to organize myself and maintain a schedule for any amount of time longer than a day. Basically, the same problem that hunts me professionally also spills in other areas of my life, I like training, however, I cannot maintain not even a little schedule for it, and if I make an schedule it tends to be forgotten in just a feel days.
	- I'm a Christian that doesn't read the Bible, a Acrobat that doesn't exercise, a father that has no quality time with the kids, a husband that can't take care of his wife, a programmer that does not code daily, basically I have been a failure my hole life, never being really good at nothing, always mediocre and incapable of real change.
	- Sometimes I have the feeling that, if I could at least start to be good at something I would get on track and improve my negative points, however I never stay in a job long enough to learn from it. I jumping all over the place without a good focus on my mind, don't know if I would like to be a programmer, a police officer, wood worker and so on, why is so difficult to choose, why can't I be good at just something. I always get good quickly at any activity, principally, if it's a physical activity, but can't do the necessary sacrifice to achieve a point of expertise.

	- Daily try to become an expert in some goal, could be code, or physical, but something to be you thing, something that people can recognize you are good at and a voice to be heard about it

	- KISS -> isn't necessary to have the best tools aways, make it do with the tools available now, and if possible improve it by refactoring in the future if at all possible
