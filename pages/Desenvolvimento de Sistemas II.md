		- **Bad Smells**
			- Is a code that will make it difficult to improve or grow the software in the future.
		- **Refactoring**
		- **Composing Methods**
			- **Extract Method** #card
				- If you reuse some functions to do a number of thing instead of repeating it you can just extract a method from it and call it when necessary
			- **Extract Class** #card
				- When a class make the job of two classes (not related methods) so instead of using only one class you can separate it in two as make simpler to work
			- **Replace array with Object** #card
				- A matrix (vector, array) contains distinct types of data, we can transform it on a object that has a separated attribute for each of them.
			- **Introduce Null Object** #card
				- If you have to manipulate date that can return a lot of Null values, instead of the validating every time to check if the value is null you can assign a Null object to the params, so the calculating return the proper value considering null.
			- **Separate Query From Modifier** #card
				- Method both consults a value and changes the value, if we split it in to two we can reuse it more easily and simply
			- **Extract Superclass** #card
				- If two or more classes has one or more things in common you can make a superclass and extend the classes from it instead.

		- **Grasp Patterns -> General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns**
		- ### Patterns
			- **Information Expert**
				- Who is responsible for the gathering of the information after the purchase?
				- the information expert is the class that should be responsible to present this information, getting it from the other classes such as products and items.
			- **Creator**
				- Is the responsible to instantiate the products of the purchase on the checkout process, for the class that has all the information about the purchase.
			- **Controllers**
				- Is the responsible to take the events such as code bar reading and searching for the code in the data base.
			- **Low Coupling**
				- How much a class depends on others to work, classes should only depend on the strict necessary for the correct operations of the software.
			- **High Cohesion**
				- All the responsibilities of a class should be related always.
