  collapsed:: true
	- ## Resolving it on the Calculated view.
		- Create a filter on the view that takes only the max data on for each of the "NOME_ARQUIVO" columns, either using a rank node for each of the "NOME_ARQUIVO" filtered in the specific View then making a union with all the data.
	- ## Resolving it with the retificacaoDirf.xsjslib file
		- Insert a conditional that finds where the "NOME_ARQUIVO" is object."NOME_ARQUIVO" then goes through the MODIFICATION_DATE taking the MAX value, and checking the flag LATEST (still to be created) to true, on the view the value can be looked by a filter that reads only the true flags besides the pre-existing filters.
- # Probable resolution
  collapsed:: true
	- Insert a field called LATEST on the table MDR::RETIFICACAO_DIRF this will act as a flag that can be read by the filter in the CV_WCIR_CURR_CPF as the CV_WCIR_CURR_CNPJ and CV_WCIR_CURR_RRA.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The method Officialise can now go through and find were the `object.NOME_ARQUIVO == NOME_ARQUIVO` make the flag LATEST that is set to `true` to false and by default insert the value of LATEST as `true`.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Besides that every time a new file is first created on a new day all the previous flags LATEST should go back to `false` that way it's clean
- # Caveats
	- on the `officialise` method make a call to getMostRecentHeaders with`object: {"filters":{"id":null,"empresa":"1000","anoCalendario":"2020"}}` get the fileName to compare with the already existing fileName on the platform.
	- I can use on the list method `filters: {"pending":1}`
