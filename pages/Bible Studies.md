	- **Romans 1:5**
		- "Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake."
	- **Romans 10:17**
		- "So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ"
	- **Hebrews 11:6**
		- "And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."
	- **My understanding**
		- If faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ and the call to obedience comes from faith for his name's sake, it is possible to say that it is not possible at all to obey without hearing the word of Christ.
