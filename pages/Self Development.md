	- ## How to lead you wife
		- ### First of all
			- Lead yourself first
			- hold hol
			- Hold yourself responsible for the things you do.
			- Do what you promised you would.
			- **BE someone it is worth following**
		- ### **Communicate** and uphold boundaries and expectations
			- The power of a union relies on the communication of the couple.
			- Lack of communication stirs the relationship both on separated paths.
			- Check you partners to uphold, with class, calm and precise communication.
		- ### Hearing and understanding our spouses
			- She will have a different perspective
			- You're not supposed to understand women, that why you partner with one.
			- Both the approaches are good, right and necessary. Maybe you don't understand the behavior of your wife and then find a middle ground.
			- Do not make her one of your buddies, treat her with the honor she deserves.
		- ### Serve her
			- It's not being a "nice guy" but take care of her.
			- Take care of the house, when possible, take care of her.
			- Protect, provide, preside.
			- Man have to prove their value, if you do not make a impact positively you are dispensable.
		- ### Cast the vision clearly
			- If you can cast a vision for the future and how to get there she will follow, she needs to know you are the one with the vision and control over yourself to achieve it.
			- Make a time to plan together, get on the same page.
		- The physical relationship will follow the emotional, spiritual side.

		- I'm unhappy with myself.
		- I feeling a bit lost, without a clear purpose and just going trough the motion, could blame this on the amount of screen time I'm being having. Perhaps the amount of screen just makes clear the, already installed problem, I do not believe my capability to make my life and the life of my family work. I cannot provide for my family, can't protect them either, also, recurrently, Kath finds my either sleeping latte, or going trough sorts on YouTube, basically, I'm the example of the things I most despise: Lazy, screen hooked people, that blame everything and everyone for their on mistakes and forget to take ownership of it. From the list of items that make me sad there is the following:
			- **I'm in bad shape**, if compared with the general population ain't bad, however compared with myself, it the worst shape ever, including the academy time.
			- **I'm lazy**, cannot make myself to make anything that matters, I just keep on waiting for something to happen, to feel the purpose and the need to do it, or either I wait for the dead line monster.
			- **I'm addicted in easy pleasure.** Most of my time I'm watching someone or something, just to make my brain run on idle, maybe to forget my failures, or to feel happy, using the video as a drug.
		- If a had to judge me as person I wanted to hang out with the probable response would be no.
		- I see aa lot of challenged people giving examples online and telling how they had to fight to compensate for their inability to do something, unfortunately I have the ability, and know how to get knowledge and execute what I want.
		- Sometimes I compare my way of thinking to a race car, either accelerating of braking, no cruising in between. I don't know if this is actually true. Either I must find the discipline to do it cruising or find what would challenge me to do it on the speed that I need.
		- ## Self Advice
			- If I has responsible for a person just like me I would say:
				- **Stop the screen time now**, no learning podcast excuse, no I like to learn shit, only do it. Stop with the fucking addiction on screen, this is making you a piece of shit.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Stop complaining of the present.** Do not think that your life will be better in the future, and then you would be happy, be happy with your family now and make the most with what you got now!
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Be the husband and the father they need.** Be the example of what a good man should be, make the bar fucking high for anyone after you.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Give yourself the challenge you need.** Find the hardest things you can and do them, use the mentality of race car in your favour and insane on this idea, stop wasting time and start to learn what you need in the most high pace that you can. Don't think only learning programming is difficult, make as difficult as a 160 mile race is, make as difficult that you dream with it, that your brain get fatigued every day. *No need to make just hard, use the most efficient tolls available and the best methods and shortcut and THEN turn on the MF crazy pace*
