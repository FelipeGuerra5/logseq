- # Problems
	- **Bad Sleep**
		- I'm going to bed very tired and without need to be this late, which in turn is lowering my drive for the day, usually I can't be productive until late in the afternoon
	- **Videos**
		- The main cause of the unslept hours I have. usually when I'm tired is the time were I let it slide
	- **Bad food**
		- Eat to make myself feel better, usually no filter around the time to sleep
	- **D.A.S.A.**
		- Also low filter around the time of sleep
- # Addressing the issues
	- Drink more water => for every time of craving drink more water.
	- I should go to bed with the wife, this would probably make me feel better and ready for the next day
	- Be careful with **"HALT"** **Hungry Angry Lonely Tired**
