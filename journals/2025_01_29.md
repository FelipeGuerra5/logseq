	- What features you have built, most recently?
		- Most recently I worked with developing a web platform for tax calculation for big companies, more precisely on the federal taxes in Brazil for a Petrobras, as a consultant from All Tax.
		- One feature I have built is a page in the software were the client could get the consolidated information about all the tax paid for a given category.
		- The build involved creating the necessary calculation views, as the client uses sap hana for database management, then acquiring this data in the node back-end, with the necessary rules of business, then make it available for the front-end via API,
		- finally building the front-end page with the company parameters and themes and display the data and filters for the client to search it properly and download it to CSV, if necessary.
