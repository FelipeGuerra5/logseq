		- https://github.com/FelipeGuerra5/PDF_NFe_Report_Reader.git
	- **Patch**
		- Some of the lines in the document are not being read.
		- This problem has happened before and was a problem with a to long string.
		- Link to verify faulty files:? https://olam-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/andrezza_nunes_ofi_com/Documents/SUSTENTABILIDADE%20ONLINE/03-FILIAL%20ITABUNA/ATSOURSE/CEDRO%20ROSA%20-%20OM%20COM%C3%89RCIO/NOTAS%20FISCAIS/01-Novas%20NF%27s%20aqui/Felipe?csf=1&web=1&e=tFxyig
	- **Problem:**
		- In one specific file the a CNPJ was inserted instead of a CPF for the document number, which has complicated the reading with RegEx
	- **Notes:**
		- CAll the documents were checked only one showed problems about the reading of it, the **nf 61195** on the above OneDrive dir.
		- Currently waiting on the response of andrezza.nunes@ofi.com

- ## Ibama Webscraping and ETL
	- #RPA #code #python #pdf #webscraping #ETL
	- **Repository:**
		- https://github.com/FelipeGuerra5/Ibama-WebScraping.git
	- **Problem:**
		- The script is pairing wrong farmers with our farmers.
		- As the search by id is virtually impossible the program should do a more specific search on the Ibama Data Frame.
	- **Action:**
		- Should probably refactor code taking in to account the current problem. The current code is not optimal for this type of criteria.
