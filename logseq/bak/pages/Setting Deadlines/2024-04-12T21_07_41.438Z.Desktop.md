- # How to Set Realistic Deadlines
	- List all tasks that need to be performed on High-Level
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Breakup the tasks in smaller pieces until you can estimate properly how long is going to take
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Assign a number of hours for each of the tasks, usually on a spreadsheet
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Add up all the time estimates
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Add extra time for testing and the unexpected
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Multiply by a safety factor of (2 - 3x) depending on your experience with this kind of task
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Do Not
	- ### Do not make a deadline based on **Hope**, instead:
		- Try to postpone tasks that are not essential for the v1 of the software
		- Simplify tasks that could work being simpler, "Perfeito Ã© inimigo do feito"
	- **It's not the end of the world if you miss it, its an estimative, not a hard truth.**
- ## Other points
	- **Error on the high side ratter on the low side.**
	- Less experience == less accurate estimates
