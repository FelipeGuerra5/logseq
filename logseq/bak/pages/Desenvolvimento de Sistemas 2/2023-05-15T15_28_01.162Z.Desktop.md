- # Aula 02
	- ## Ponto de partida
		- Martin Fouler - Bad Smells
		- ### Refactoring:
			- Composing Method
				- Extract Method => A code fragment can be grouped -> Changte this code for a method and call this method.
			- Moving Features Between Objects
				- Extract Class => When a class does the job of two classes -> broke it down to 2 classes so it can e come cohesive.
			- Organizing Data
				- Replace Array with Object => An array with multiple data with different types of data -> change it for one object (e. g. class).
			- Simplifying Conditional Expression
				- Introduce Null Objects => Instead of creating conditional for the null case make a object for the null e.g. inside of a class that may receive null quite sometimes insert a subclass as null this way only deal with it once.
			- Simplifying Method Calls
				- Separate Query from Modifier => Some method returns a value but also modify some value when you call it, make two methods, one to queries other for changing
			- Dealing with Generalization
				- Extract superclass => some classes have many methods in common but not all -> make a superclass that can be parent for all this classes and the class only extends this superclass.
