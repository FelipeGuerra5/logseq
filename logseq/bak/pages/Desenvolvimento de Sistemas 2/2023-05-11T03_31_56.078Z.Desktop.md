		- Martin Fouler - Bad Smells
		- ### Refactoring:
			- Composing Method
				- Extract Method => A code fragment can be grouped -> Changte this code for a method and call this method.
			- Moving Features Between Objects
				- Extract Class => When a class does the job of two classes -> broke it down to 2 classes so it can e come cohesive.
			- Organizing Data
				- Replace Array with Object => An array with multiple data with different types of data -> change it for one object (e. g. class).
			- Simplifying Conditional Expression
				- Introduce Null Objects => Instead of creating conditional for the null case make a object for the null e.g. inside of a class that may receive null quite sometimes insert a subclass as null this way only deal with it once.
			- Simplifying Method Calls
				- Separate Query from Modifier => Some method returns a value but also modify some value when you call it, make two methods, one to queries other for changing
			- Dealing with Generalization
				- Extract superclass => some classes have many methods in common but not all -> make a superclass that can be parent for all this classes and the class only extends this superclass.

		- ### GRASP - General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns
			- It manages what kind of responsibility each object should get.
			- What are the **Grasp**  concepts bellow:
			  1. information Expert
			  2. Creator
			  3. Controller
			  4. Low Coupling
			  5. High Cohesion #card
				- **Information Expert** -> Is the one that hold the unchanged information through time
				- **Creator** -> It is the one that creates a new instance of an object in the scenario.
				- **Controller** -> It's the responsible for input of data
				- **Low Coupling** -> How dependent the classes are of each other. If a class depends on many other on the event you may try to reuse it, you will have to bring all the other classes this one is dependent on.
				  id:: 644a0ab6-cf13-42e1-81e1-dd13f66dde9c
				- **High Cohesion** -> If the class has a lot of methods, they need to be very cohesive between themselves, so it does not brake on building.

		- ### GRASP - General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns
			- It manages what kind of responsibility each object should get.
				- What are the **Grasp**  concepts bellow:
				  1. Polymorphism
				  2. Pure Fabrication
				  3. Protected Variations #card
				- **Polymorphism** -> It's an class that can be extended in to others, e.g.: there is some payment method to pay a bill instead of referencing all the existing methods in the  `abstract class Payments` you can just make it an then extend to the other classes that handle types of payment.
				- **Pure Fabrication Indirection** -> If you need just one functionality, instead of attributing the functionality to other class, is better to just make a new one even thought it's only for one specific method.
				- **Protected Variations** -> If there is an value that will be used and can be different for different client, it is better to let it be indirect, on a specific class instead of inside another, taxes for example may vary from one state to another, so it's smart to make indirect from other classes won't change.

	- ## Ponto de Partida
		- Patterns **GoF** -> Gang of Four
			- There are 3 groups of GoF patterns
			- 1. Creational
			  2. Behavioral
			  3. Structural
			- Let's Start with the **Creational**, more precisely this 3 patterns
				- **GoF** -> **Singleton** #card
					- It's a class that has only one instance.
					  1. Private instance
					  2. Need's a private constructor.
					  3. `GetInstance()` method.
				- **GoF** -> **Factory Method** #card
					- This uses a factory method where you can use a class that builds only what you specified, e.g.: a juice factory, you can call factory and then the flavor of the juice.
				- **GoF** -> **Abstract Method** #card
					- On the abstract factory method the family is well defined, however each children class can have a different outcome for the method.
					- let say vehicles class, all have to accelerate and break,  a car uses pedals, motorcycle used the wrist throttle and do on.

		- ### Useful link
			- [UML - Visual paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-aggregation-vs-composition/)
		- **UML - Agregation** #card
			- In comparison to a PC the screen aggregate to the PC but it will work without it.
		- **UML - Composition** #card
			- The item is composed with the given object, if you try to take it out the code will fail there.

	- ## Ponto de Partida
		- **GoF - Behavioral Design Patterns**
			- **State** -> After the state of an object changes I want it to change behavior.
				- For that to happen a class should be created for managing each type of state as e.g.:
				- ```Java `interface State {
				  interface State {
				    void handle ();
				  }
				  
				  class ConcreteStateA implements State {
				    public void handel(){
				      // Code
				    }
				  }
				  
				  class ConcreteStateB implements State {
				    public void handle () {
				      // Code
				    }
				  }
				  ```
			- Let's say you have a a application that handles Mortgages, that could be
				- 1. **In Analysis**
				  2. **Accepted**
				  3. **Denied**
				- For each of these we are going to need a specific class to implement the Mortgage handle class
			- **Strategy** ->
				- Let's say we are going to handle a maps application where you can choose the type transportation you're going to use. for each of them you will have different:
					- 1. Times
					  2. Routes
					  3. Cost
					  4. If it's available now or not.
					  5. The algorithm that calculate the route and so on.
