		- Asked both Raphaela and William Tomaz, Tomaz responded with other ticket EF that helped.
		- obs: also was resolving misunderstanding on the previous ticket (still pending)
	- DONE Awaiting file for testing the previous step

		- Asked both Raphaela and William Tomaz -> told me to ask Arthur
		- Arthur showed me the step by step for finding the issue and explained that the underlining cause of the problem is that sometimes the user may rectify more than one time documents with same name, for different years, so instead of just let the code change the flags, now it must look for the date and if the data is on the same day it will need to only add the line instead of changing the flags.
		- DONE Rewatch doing step by step.

- # Steps
	- NOW Read the function **officialize** and understand were it needs a change to consider the data of officialization.

	  CLOCK: [2023-10-19 Thu 13:13:46]
	  :END:
		- NOW Reading all the function -> 90 min
		  :LOGBOOK:
		  CLOCK: [2023-10-19 Thu 13:13:41]
		  :END:
		- LATER Methods called -> 60 min
		- LATER Write what each block of code does -> 60 min
		- LATER Debug with files and see it's behaviour -> 90 min
	- LATER make a conditional that reads the data of the new file and the old one and compare with the date on official.
		- LATER Create the first conditional and check if its gets active -> 30 min
		- LATER Make the data analysis -> 30 min
		- LATER Run files and debug (Each day its a new one) -> 90 min
		- # Deadline
			- Sum all individually -> multiply by the safety factor of 3 for I do not know this system well enough yet.
			- 450 * 3 = 1350 min => **23 hours**
